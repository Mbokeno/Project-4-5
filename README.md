# Project-4-5
This is data from a survey I created using the five questions detailed below. This data includes the responses of ten people (with their consent), and a description of their age, gender, and number of years they have been in school. These are the 5 questions that were used in the survey:
Q1: There is widespread mental health epidemics, problems such as depression and anxiety and many more. But WHY? In our opinion, what is the leading cause and what is the second-leading cause of this collective increase? For each of them can you briefly mention how that factor leads to a mental health problem?
Q2: What is your favorite thing about the modern human life, what is your second-favorite thing, and what is your least-favorite thing?
Q3: name the biggest factor that, in our opinion, today, harms the mental health of mothers specifically.
Q4: name the biggest factor that, in our opinion, today, harms the mental health of fathers specifically. 
Q5: name the biggest factor that, in our opinion, today, harms the mental health of children specifically. 
The column name descriptions starting from column 4 are as follows:
4) suggested leading cause in Q1 (in less than 3 words)
5) suggested second-leading cause in Q1 (in less than 3 words)
6) suggested mechanism (answer to the "how" question in Q1) for leading cause in Q1 (insert fully, don't summarize)
7) suggested mechanism for second-leading cause in Q1 (in full)
8) favorite modern feature in Q2
9) second favorite modern feature in Q2
10) least favorite modern feature in Q2
